This is Homework #2
 
PROBLEMS

this our first major homework, in this homework we actually used a framework. first of all I would like to mention the biggest problem i had throughout this homework were really dumb and stupidity typos; simple things like closing a tags, missing a chevron. or a quotation mark thing like that. I realize I have to pay more attention to my code so I can spend less time debugging.

JOY 

I also enjoy doing it. I caught myself spending 6 to 7 hours non stop doing homework without noticing, it felt good when you finally solved a problem. I feel like that's just the beginning of it.

LANGUAGES

We did not use any scripting languages in this project, yet it felt challenging. We only use HTML% and CSS and bootstarp frameworks which felt like cheating to me because all I did was copy and paste and remove the extra P tags or div tags I did not want.
 
I can't wait to see what the future hold for this class

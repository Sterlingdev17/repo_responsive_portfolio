This is Homework #2
 
problems I had in this homework
this our first major homework, in this homework we actually used a framework. first of all I would like to mention the biggest problem i had throughout this homework were really dumb and stupidity typos; simple things like closing a tags, messing a chevron. or a quotation mark ect..
 
I also enjoy doing it. I caught myself spending 6 to 7 hours non stop doing homework without noticing, it felt good when you finally solved a problem. I feel like that's just the beginning of it.
 
languages we used in this homework
We did not use any scripting languages in this project, yet it felt challenging. We only use HTML% and CSS and bootstarp frameworks which felt like cheating to me because all I did was copy and paste and remove the extra P tags or div tags I did not want.
 
I can't wait to see what the future hold for this class
